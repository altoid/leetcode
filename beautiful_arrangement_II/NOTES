1 <= k < n <= 10 ** 4

the solution is quadratic.  to find the answer for k you have to find the answers for 1 .. k-1 first.

1.  start with the ints 1..n in sorted order.
2.  for k = 1, do nothing
3.  for k = 2, reverse the numbers [1:-1]
4.  for k = 3, reverse the numbers [1:-1] then reverse [2:-1]

and so on.  example for n = 7

k = 1:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7
k = 2:  1 7 6 5 4 3 2
k = 3:  1 7 2 3 4 5 6
k = 4:  1 7 2 6 5 4 3
k = 5:  1 7 2 6 3 4 5
k = 6:  1 7 2 6 3 5 4
